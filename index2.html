<p class = "paragraph">
Isn’t it utterly frustrating to find no vacant seats in a room? SeatMe is an app designed with students and customers in mind. SeatMe gives you the ability to reserve multiple seats before arriving at the location. A SeatMe compatible university or restaurant is designed to keep track on the number of present visitors in the room, as well as the vacant seats left in the room. 
<br>
<br>

Each seat is attached with a thermal sensor to detect the presence of a human. When a person sits, the thermal sensor updates the information on the whole grid of seats, thereby updating the app’s contents. 


<br>
<br>
Sensors are placed at every entrance of a building and their floors to keep track of the number of students in the room currently. In the event of a fire or emergency, the sensors trigger a buzzer until it records no persons in the room. The sensors also decide to switch off all lights when no person is present in the room, thereby conserving energy.
